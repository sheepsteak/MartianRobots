Martian Robots
==============

* Project has InputFile.txt included and set to be copied to output folder.
* Can add more instructions by subclassing Instruction.
* Used an IGrid to pass to robots. I was thinking that this would allow for other types of grids (or maybe other shapes?). This does mean at the moment the robots will never know they are moving around on Mars though :(

How to run
----------

In output folder:

    MartianRobots.exe InputFile.txt
    
Future Improvements
-------------------

* Allow for different types of robots. Maybe ones that are bigger or maybe more intelligent (refuse to ever leave the grid?)
